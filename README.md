curr_proj - organize your programming projects in TUI.
curr_proj is TUI ncurses script that represents all user defined projects and .sh scripts to open them with Enter key. It was created to recover work on old projects after a long break.
It's useful when you want to start at blank TUI and open X/Wayland (or your DE) with your project tools and chosen configuration.
